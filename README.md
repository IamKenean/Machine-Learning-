Machine Learning Projects Collection
This repository contains a series of machine learning projects that demonstrate various algorithms and techniques applied to different datasets. Each project focuses on a specific problem and provides a step-by-step approach to solving it using machine learning.

Projects Included
Diabetes Prediction: Uses the PIMA Diabetes Dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction: Classifies objects as rocks or mines based on sonar readings using a Logistic Regression model.
Kaggle Skin Disease Classification: Classifies skin conditions using deep learning
Kaggle Weather Classificaiton: Classifies weather  using deep learning
General Workflow
Data Collection and Analysis

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explore and analyze the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Data Preprocessing

Separate features (X) and target labels (Y).
Standardize or normalize data if necessary to improve model performance.
Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring a representative distribution of the target variable.
Model Training

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression).
Train the model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
Compare performance on training and testing datasets to check for overfitting or underfitting.
Making Predictions

Develop a predictive system to classify new data inputs.
Preprocess input data and use the trained model to make predictions.
Interpret and display the prediction results.
